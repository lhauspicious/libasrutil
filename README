asrutil is a utility for ASR (automatic speech recognition), it is based on baidu asr sample.
=====================================================
(You can use it in commercial software, but please let me know.)
This application is dedicated to my lovely son (Hean Yu).

How to build asrutil from source code?

  there is VAD (Voice Active Detection) in run_voice_zh_4, this is a good sample for your reference.
